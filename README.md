# SWIFTDOCS-basic-operators
Swift documentation â†’ An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values. For example, the addition operator (+) adds two numbers, as in let i = 1 + 2, and the logical AND operator (&amp;&amp;) combines two Boolean values, as in if `enteredDoorCode` &amp;&amp; `passedRetinaScan`.
